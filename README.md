# ssh-over-mcp

**Policy-enforced SSH remote control for MCP-compatible AI agents.**

`ssh-over-mcp` is a remote host control plane that exposes SSH-backed host administration capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It is designed for ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, autonomous agents, and other MCP clients while preserving server-side control over what each agent may do.

The project is intentionally **not** a thin wrapper around `/bin/bash`. Every operation is expected to pass through authentication, host inventory, role/policy evaluation, risk classification, optional approval, remote host enforcement, and audit logging.

## Current status

**Phase 3d2b2b2b2 — containment start barrier.**

Implemented through the current development branch:

- host-policy v3 and fd-pinned native execution;
- sanitized child supervisor and bounded parent I/O;
- host-owned child rlimits;
- concrete cgroup-v2 containment backend;
- new contained-spawn path with a dedicated CLOEXEC start-barrier pipe;
- containment request ID must match the prepared command request ID;
- containment scope is created before fork;
- child blocks before session setup/exec;
- parent attaches the child to containment before sending the one-byte release;
- attach/release failures keep the child from entering the exec path and trigger bounded cleanup;
- successful spawned children retain their containment handle for later termination/accounting integration.

**Remote command execution is still disabled in the ForceCommand CLI.** The bounded runner still uses the older uncontained spawn path; the next phase switches timeout/output termination and cleanup to containment-aware execution.


## Documentation is the source of truth

The canonical specification lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md). If code and documentation disagree, the documentation defines intended behavior until an explicit architecture decision changes it.

- [Threat model](docs/threat-model.md)
- [Policy specification](docs/policy-spec.md)

Agents and contributors should also read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Security model in one paragraph

Policy is **default deny**. Allow rules define intended capability; deny rules override allows. The control plane never accepts arbitrary target addresses, usernames, SSH keys, or host keys from the model. Hosts come from server-side inventory. Structured command execution is preferred over shell strings. Raw shell is a separate privileged capability. Sensitive or high-risk actions can require short-lived, scope-bound approval. The remote host independently enforces restrictions using a dedicated SSH account, `ForceCommand`, OS permissions, and optional privileged helpers. The model is not a security boundary.

## Python support

The package requires **Python 3.13 or newer**. CI explicitly validates the currently released stable series 3.13 and 3.14; newer Python feature releases are added to the validation matrix as they become stable.

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest
```

A loadable reference policy is in [`config/policy.example.yaml`](config/policy.example.yaml).

## Non-goals

The initial project does not aim to:

- replace SSH as a transport;
- expose unrestricted root access by default;
- accept arbitrary network targets from an LLM;
- treat command blacklists as the primary security boundary;
- rely on prompts or client-side confirmation as authorization;
- store long-lived host credentials in model-visible configuration.
